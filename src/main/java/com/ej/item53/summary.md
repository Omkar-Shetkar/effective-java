## Item 53: Use varargs judiciously

- varargs are useful in methods where we expect variable number of arguments
- methods which expect atleast one or more arguments, needs special attention while using varargs
- varargs have slight impact on performance. Hence, while designing methods with varargs, take judicious decision on
frequent method calls with number of arguments.
